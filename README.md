#PROBLEM STATEMENT
Most African writers deal with the problem of limited access to publishing platforms.This main issue
makes it almost impossible for them to promote their work to a large audience .It brings about lack of visibility and engagement with their readers. Social media apps like Instagram and tiktok are used forbook promotion but most African authors aren’t still able to gain any engagements.
We are all aware that there's no shortage on talent in this continent. We are literally filled with people who want to tell their stories but due to lack of editors, publicists, funds and agents, writing and publishing novels has become a nightmare for many Africans. They all tend to use social media apps for book promotion, but these applications have a very large fanbases and with a lot of content in different categories. Users are expected to pay and boost content, hoping that visiblity equates virality and more opportunities. Even though there are very few cases of successful African writers using this platform, the majority  complain of no rewards from these applications despite all their hardwork.
Most publishing offers would hardly love to support Africans who write with certain paragraphs in their native languages. Hence there's a need for an african platform to sponsor such literature.
UNESCO carried out research and found out that majority of the continent's book industry has a worth of 7 billion out of the global 129 billion market brought about by weak distribution and weak digital reach.
